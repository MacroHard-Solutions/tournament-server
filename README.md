# Tournament Server
This is our Software Design project which facilitates the creation and hosting of online game tournaments.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to design an online platform for University students to take part in online game tournaments for which they design programs to play. These programs can either be hosted on other online platforms that will communicate with this interface in order to play moves in the game, or will run locally on their machine and communicate with this server.

## Sketches
The sketches folder is meant to store how we want the website for our tournament server to appear to the user.
